        <h2><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
        <p>
            The current system of yard waste collection in Chicago is lacking in efficiency and leads to a high percentage of yard waste going to landfills. This newly proposed system will increase properly collected yard waste and motivate residents to participate. By collecting yard waste during the busy season, incentivizing participation on the off-season, and fining those who do not properly sort waste, the percentage of collected yard waste will increase without wasted resources. 
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Our Team:</strong></h2>
        <p>
            This idea was developed by our team of five students from Illinois Institute of Technology.<br>
            Max Oellien and Salem Abuammer are computer science majors with a machine learning focus.<br>
            Rachael Brooks is a computer science major with a minor in entrepreneurship.<br>
            Paulina Pys is a behavioral health & wellness/nutrition major.<br>
            Megan Heurich is a communication major with a minor in entrepreneurship.            
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Project Description:</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Chicago’s current method of yard waste disposal leads to a high amount of yard waste going into landfills instead of being properly disposed of or composted. Our proposed method of waste disposal will significantly increase the amount of waste being properly collected and disposed of and increase the community involvement in waste disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our method is one that depends on the seasons to determine the rate of waste collection and the type of waste collection. We propose a hybrid of collection methods depending on the season. 
        </p>
        <h3><em>In-Season Collection (May-November):</em></h3>
        <p>
            During the seasons that yard waste is the highest, door-to-door collection waste will be collected every two weeks from May to August, collected every week from September to November. 
        </p>
        <h3><em>Off-Season Collection (December-April):</em></h3>
        <p>
            On the off-seasons, which are times of the year where yard waste is lowest, waste will be collected from a predetermined spot every two weeks. There will be multiple spots throughout the city that should be walking distance from the residents that are expected to utilize those spots and easy to access from the drivers that will be collecting in those spots. 
        </p>
        <h3><em>Incentive:</em></h3>
        <p>
            In order to incentivize collection, communities with the highest amount of waste collected will receive a monetary bonus towards their park districts/community parks. This will be a weighted number, communities with less trees will have a weight multiplied to their collected waste depending on the amount of greenery that is in the average yard. Individuals that do not properly sort their waste will receive a small fine.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Budget:</strong></h2>
        <p>
            This method will require no new facilities or equipment. This means that there is no cost to begin using this method. The money received from fines will be used to fund the monetary bonus towards the parks. Revenue can also be generated from the sale of compost generated by the yard waste. 
        </p>
        <h3><em>Approximate Yearly Cost:</em></h3>
        <p>
            Gas - $10,000
            <br>
            Labor - $200,000
            <br>
            <strong>Total -  $210,000 </strong>           
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This newly proposed system will increase properly collected yard waste and motivate residents to participate. By collecting yard waste during the busy season, incentivizing participation on the off-season, and fining those who do not properly sort waste, the percentage of collected yard waste will increase without wasted resources.
